                    <div align="center"><p>Congratulations to these Business Partners - winners of the Putting People First Award for June 2016.</p></div>

                    <h2 class="name">Seth Garcia</h2>
                    <p><strong>Field services specialist, information technology, CHG, Salt Lake City</strong><br />
                    Nominated by Amanda Curtis and Tricia Warnken</p>

                    <p>"Seth is always friendly, leads with great customer service and helps us be successful in our jobs," Tricia writes in her nomination. "Whenever I need help with something, he makes me feel important, and regardless of the issue is happy to help. Today I was having problems logging into Outlook, and even though it wasn't a quick fix, Seth did what he always does — he treated me with respect, kindness, friendliness and support." Amanda adds insight to the kind of person Seth is to work with. "This morning I overheard Seth talking to a customer," she recalls. "When working in customer service, it can be easy to let others' frustration set the tone, but Seth was polite and calm. Great job, Seth!"</p>

                    <h2 class="name">Thomas Peel</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hospital privileges assistant, CompHealth locum tenens, Salt Lake City</strong><br />
                    Nominated by Emily Bytheway and Randi Peery</p>

                    <p>"Yesterday, I was having a bad day (like everybody does from time to time)," Randi shares. "I left my desk, and when I returned, Thomas asked me if I needed a hug! I absolutely did! It was such a small gesture and I instantly felt better. This is the kind of environment that makes CompHealth a great place to work. Thomas knew I was having a rough moment and took a few minutes to be kind and thoughtful when I needed it." Emily describes the way Thomas recently took on the responsibility of managing hospital privileges for Minnesota and how smoothly the process has gone for providers working there. "His communication is on point, he's quick to follow up, and he cares a lot about each file," she says. "It is totally inspiring!"</p>

                    <h2 class="name">Megan Peters</h2>
                    <p><strong>Marketing coordinator II, CHG, Salt Lake City</strong><br />
                    Nominated by Tricia Warnken</p>
					
                    <p>"Megan just celebrated a year at CHG, and she has been living our core value of Putting People First since she walked in the door," Tricia shares. "In the 365 days of working with her, she has come to work with a positive attitude and lifts the team, department and company with her energy, friendliness and demeanor. Recently, she offered to support a Locumstory booth in Long Island — no biggie, except that she was only in New York because she was headed to Iceland on a personal vacation and had a long layover! Megan has a very bright future, and I am thrilled that she has chosen to be part of our team at CHG!"</p>

                    <h2 class="name">Joshua Robbins</h2>
                    <p><strong>Senior analyst, Lean team, CHG, Salt Lake City</strong><br />
                    Nominated by Sean Smith</p>

                    <p>Sean's family recently welcomed a new baby boy, but days after returning home, his wife experienced a medical emergency that returned her to the hospital. "Our three boys went from one family to another while she was in the hospital," Sean shares. "In turmoil like this, we put many responsibilities like dishes and laundry on the back burner. Josh knew about my family's struggle and took time out of his evening to mow, edge and weed my front and backyard. I am not one to accept help, but Josh identified a need and took it on himself to serve my family. This was a burden lifted for me. I can't thank him enough."</p>

                    <h2 class="name">Amy Spicer</h2>
                    <p><strong>Accounts receivable billing specialist II, CHG, Salt Lake City</strong><br />
                    Nominated by Gayle Parker</p>

                    <p>When Amy recently answered a call from an upset client regarding an invoice, she didn't lose her cool. "Amy helped this individual calm down and then moved forward resolving the problem," Gayle writes. Later, the client expressed appreciation for the way Amy handled the situation. "Amy always gets her work done early and is willing to help her team with a smile on her face," Gayle continues. Others on the team explain how relieving it is to know Amy is taking care of their high-profile clients because they know her service is always top-notch. "Amy is the biggest supporter of our team, is always going the extra mile and is a great team player," Gayle concludes. "Thank you, Amy, for your example!"</p>

                    <h2 class="name">Liz Van Halsema</h2>
                    <p><strong>Corporate communications coordinator II, CHG, Salt Lake City</strong><br />
                    Nominated by Vanessa Hoy</p>

                    <p>"As a leader, I love when I see people on my team fully embracing our culture of Putting People First," Vanessa explains. She recounts a story from Tyra Pounds on the culture team, who attributes the success of the Employee Compassion Fund 5K in part to Liz's help, "With the support of Liz throughout the last month and the day of the 5K, we raised more than $1,200 in one-time donations, even though the morning was cold and rainy. We couldn't have done this without her," Tyra says. "Liz's initiative, passion and enthusiasm make my team and CHG a better place to work," Vanessa concludes. "We're lucky to have her and a constant reminder of what Putting People First is all about!"</p>
