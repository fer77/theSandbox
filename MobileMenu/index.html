    <p>Wait, I like the library. I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately.</p><img src="http://images.apple.com/v/ipad-air-2/c/images/overview/design_large.png" alt=""/>
    <p>I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger. Explore the morgue? It's not meant to be hilarious. It's supposed to be erotic. Let's raise our glasses! Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. I don't know. Eating lobster? It goes against everything we were taught to believe. Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. We can make this work. We can work out a dating wheel, just like a chore wheel. Let's put the try in triangle.</p>
    <p>Don't have a crap attack. You had me at horses, but then you lost me at corpses. Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately.</p>
